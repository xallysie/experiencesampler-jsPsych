An open-source smartphone app designed for experience-sampling studies, integrated into <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/" target="_blank">jsPsych (7.3)</a>. Based on **<a href="http://www.experiencesampler.com/" target="_blank">ExperienceSampler</a>** developed by Sabrina Thai and Liz Page-Gould, it's built on JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Cordova, an open-source library that allows JavaScript to access native device functions. Data storage is accomplished using Google's (basically free) <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> Cloud Firestore and additionally as a backup, the <a href="https://pipe.jspsych.org/" target="_blank">Datapipe API</a> for jsPsych which sends your data directly to OSF.
