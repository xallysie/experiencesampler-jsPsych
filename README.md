# experiencesampler-jsPsych
*Experience-sampling extension for jsPsych framework (7.3), developed for Android (6+, compatible with 13+, api33) and iOS (9+).*

An open-source smartphone app designed for experience-sampling studies, integrated into <a href="https://www.jspsych.org/7.3/" target="_blank">jsPsych (7.3)</a>. App development code and documentation based on the open-source **<a href="http://www.experiencesampler.com/" target="_blank">ExperienceSampler</a>** scaffold developed by [Sabrina Thai](https://github.com/sabrinathai) and Liz Page-Gould (see [paper](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-26156-001)). Built on JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, and Cordova, an open-source library that allows JavaScript to access native device functions. Data storage is accomplished using Google's (basically free) <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" target="_blank">Firebase</a> Cloud Firestore and, additionally as a backup, the <a href="https://pipe.jspsych.org/" target="_blank">Datapipe API</a> for jsPsych which sends your data directly to OSF.
